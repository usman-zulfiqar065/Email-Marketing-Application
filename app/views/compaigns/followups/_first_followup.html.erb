Hi {NAME}!

Did you read my previous email?

Hope you're well. I wanted to follow up on my previous email about boosting your online presence with a professionally designed website.

I didn't hear back from you or anyone on your team.

If it makes sense to talk further, let me know how your calendar looks for the next few weeks for a 5-10 minute call.

If not, who is the appropriate person for me to speak to?

Thanks for your help.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
